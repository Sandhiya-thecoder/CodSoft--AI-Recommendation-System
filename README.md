<h3 align="center">✨ A Smart Python-Based Movie Recommender using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity ✨</h3>

<p align="center">
This project builds an intelligent <b>movie recommendation system</b> that suggests similar movies  
based on their plot descriptions using <b>TF-IDF Vectorization</b> and <b>Cosine Similarity</b>.  
It’s a simple yet powerful example of how AI understands text and relationships between movies. 🎥🤖
</p>

---

## 🧠 Features
- 🎯 Recommends the **Top 5 most similar movies** based on text similarity  
- 🧮 Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to analyze movie plots  
- ⚡ Fast, efficient, and easy to understand  
- 💻 Perfect beginner project to explore **Machine Learning + Python**  

---

## 🎓 Learning Objectives
- Learn how **TF-IDF** converts text into meaningful numerical features  
- Understand **Cosine Similarity** for measuring text closeness  
- Practice using **pandas** and **scikit-learn** for data analysis  
- Gain confidence in building your first AI-driven Python project  

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the required libraries before running the project:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
````

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Save the code as **`movie_recommendation.py`**
2. Run the file:

   ```bash
   python movie_recommendation.py
   ```
3. Enter any movie title (e.g., `Inception`)
4. Get 5 most similar movie recommendations instantly! 🍿

---

## 💻 Example Output

```text
Enter a movie title: Inception

Top 5 movie recommendations for 'Inception':
Interstellar (Similarity Score: 0.3452)
The Matrix (Similarity Score: 0.2874)
The Dark Knight (Similarity Score: 0.2219)
The Social Network (Similarity Score: 0.1983)
Avatar (Similarity Score: 0.1734)
```

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

* 🧭 Add **genre and cast similarity** for better recommendations
* 🌐 Create a **web interface** using Flask or Streamlit
* 🎬 Connect to a real-world movie dataset like **IMDb or TMDb**
